Based on this lab, using branches is a powerful and safe way for a team of software engineers because it is organized and causes less conflict when collaborating on a single project. Branches allow software engineerings to work on different sections whatever they may be, separate from the main code. This prevents from a software engineer from pushing some code onto the main code that may break it. Branches keep main code safe and allows multiple software engineers to work on the code in their own bubble
